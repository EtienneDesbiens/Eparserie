# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Eparserie** is a Python-based web scraping project that collects grocery store deals and pricing information. It integrates with the Spoonacular API, uses Playwright for web scraping, and can send notifications via Gmail.

**Python Version:** 3.12.10

## Development Setup

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure Environment
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:
- `POSTAL_CODE` — Canadian postal code for store location filtering
- `GMAIL_ADDRESS` and `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` — Gmail credentials for sending deal notifications
- `EMAIL_RECIPIENT` — Where to send deal alerts
- `SPOONACULAR_API_KEY` — API key for ingredient/recipe data
- `MAX_DEALS_PER_STORE` — Limit for deal results per store

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run a single test file
pytest tests/test_file.py

# Run a specific test
pytest tests/test_file.py::test_function_name

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

Test configuration is in `pytest.ini`.

## Project Structure

- **scrapers/** — Web scraping logic and data collection modules
- **tests/** — Unit and integration tests

## Key Dependencies

- **Playwright** — Browser automation for web scraping
- **requests** — HTTP requests for APIs
- **Jinja2** — Template rendering (likely for email notifications)
- **python-dotenv** — Environment variable management
- **pytest** — Testing framework with mocking support

## CodeGraph

This project uses CodeGraph for code exploration. Run `codegraph index` after adding new files to keep the symbol index updated.
